# Existing Personal Mobility Solutions: Limitations and Gaps

Current individual transport options fail to meet the new criteria of versatility, adaptability, and ease of use across diverse scenarios. They often lack the ability to operate effectively both on the move and when stationary, do not free the user’s hands, and cannot adjust the user’s position for various tasks. These shortcomings become even more apparent when considering additional categories of conventional mobility solutions.

---

# Electric Wheelchairs

- Primarily designed for seated, low-level positioning, limiting interaction with objects at different heights.
- Often require assistance from another person in complex conditions.


---

# Outdor Platforms for Individuals with Disabilities

- Restricted to specific use-cases and user capabilities.
- Limited adaptability in complex urban environments (e.g., navigating elevators, narrow hallways).
- Lack user-adjustable height or a hands-free control interface.
- Less suitable for rapid response or changing conditions.

---

# Electric Scooters

- Designed for continuous motion and active balance, making stationary use difficult or unsafe.
- Rely on hands-on control, preventing multitasking or performing tasks while stationary.
- Offer no built-in support for carrying equipment, cargo, or life-support modules.
- Fixed riding positions with no height adjustment limit ergonomic comfort and adaptability.

---

# Monowheels

- Even more balance-dependent than scooters, requiring constant user input to remain stable.
- Maintaining control demands continuous attention.
- Not designed for integrated equipment or cargo, restricting their usefulness in more demanding scenarios.


---

# Folding Bicycles

- Intended mainly for short-distance commuting with limited adaptability to stationary or indoor tasks.
- Require physical effort (pedaling), unsuitable for prolonged stationary use or when user energy is limited.
- Offer no height adjustment or integrated support for additional equipment.
- Still occupy space when folded, complicating use in confined environments.

---

# Light Motorcycles and Scooters

- Primarily outdoor solutions designed for road conditions and speeds, unsuitable for indoor or confined spaces.
- Lack height adjustment and hands-free capabilities; user’s posture and interaction options are limited.
- Generally not stable or practical for stationary tasks, requiring both balance and physical input.

---

# Mini-Cars and Micro-Vehicles

- More stable at rest, but too large and heavy for use in buildings, elevators, or narrow corridors.
- Lack transformative features; cannot easily be adapted for pedestrian areas, indoor spaces, or mixed environments.
- Typically require dedicated infrastructure (parking, roads) and are not suitable for carrying specialized monitoring equipment in a flexible manner.
- Offer no height adjustment or hands-free operation, limiting their versatility in different tasks.

# Conclusion: The Need for a New Approach

From specialized disability platforms to micro-cars, existing solutions remain too rigid, narrowly focused, and unable to meet emerging needs:

- Adjustable height for various tasks and environments.
- Stability and function while stationary.
- Hands-free control enabling multitasking.
- Compatibility with monitoring and life-support equipment.

The absence of these capabilities underscores the urgency of developing a fundamentally new personal mobility system designed for the evolving challenges ahead.
